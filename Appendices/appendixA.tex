\section{Amplificator}\label{apsec:amp}

This is the circuit that comes after the voltage multiplier (section \ref{sec:models}), it simply consists of two inverting amplifiers with one amplifying the results by 10. Figure TODO shows this simple circuit.

A non-inverting amplifier was producing too much difference from the expected result (about a 20\% error) %TODO maybe show something
