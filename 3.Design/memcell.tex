\section{Memory cells}
\label{sec:memcell}

The memory cell is a circuit that is able to store an analog value for a limited time. It works using capacitors that have the ability to store a voltage for a short time.

The circuit is shown in figure \ref{fig:memcellCircuit}. The value/voltage is trapped in the capacitor using CMOS switches.


I chose to use a two CMOS switches design to avoid voltage leakage through the swicthes. As figure \ref{fig:memcellLoss} shows that only using 1 CMOS swicth leads to a large memory leak due to the high voltage difference on both sides of the CMOS swicth. Using two CMOS switches allows for this difference to be mitigated.
