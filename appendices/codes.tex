\section{Smoothing the curve}\label{apsec:smoothFunc}

The code for smoothing the curve takes in a list and the averaging range. The function returns the averaged list.

\section{Saving weights to a file}\label{apsec:saveWei}

There are a few functions that show how the weights are saved into a file.
First depending on the type of layer, the weights need to be set in a list in the correct order.
Once those list are correctly set everything is saved in a binary file.

\section{Weights to resistances}\label{apsec:wei2res}

The function takes in a weight and returns a tuple with the two resistances values. The global variables are set to set values chosen in this work.
