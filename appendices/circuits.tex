\section{Buffer}\label{apsec:buffer}

This is a classic circuit that only takes one \ac{opAmp} wired as \cref{fig:buffer}. It is used to forward a voltage without interfering the node of the input voltage.

The input is $V_{in}$ and the output is $V_{out}$.

\section{Inverting amplifier}\label{apsec:invAmp}

This is the circuit that comes after the voltage multiplier (\cref{sec:models}), it is here to amplify the results of the voltage multiplier by 10. Sometimes, its use doubles as an adder making it an inverting summing amplifier (TODO circuit).
